**NoteSmith is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).** It brings AI-assisted editing to your markdown notes ‚Äî letting you revise, rephrase, and clean up entire notes at once using the OpenAI API.

It's designed to help you refine raw thoughts into publishable content ‚Äî without ever leaving your vault.

Most note-taking tools help you *capture* ideas. But they rarely help you *improve* them.

NoteSmith is built to help you:
- Refactor messy or stream-of-consciousness notes
- Summarize long passages
- Rewrite in a different tone or format
- Get quick, AI-powered editorial feedback
- Automate repetitive edits across your vault
