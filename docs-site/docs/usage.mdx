# 🚀 Usage

NoteSmith lets you use AI (via the OpenAI API) to revise, summarize, or transform entire notes in Obsidian with just a few clicks. This guide walks you through the basic and advanced features.

---

## ✨ Basic Usage

Once you've installed NoteSmith and added your OpenAI API key, you're ready to edit!

### 🔄 Run a Default Rewrite

1. Open any note you want to revise
2. Press `Ctrl+P` (or `Cmd+P` on Mac) to open the **Command Palette**
3. Run `NoteSmith: Rewrite Note`
4. The plugin will:
- Send your note's content to the OpenAI API
- Apply the default prompt (e.g., “Rewrite this for clarity and grammar”)
- Replace your note with the edited version

> ✅ Your original content is automatically backed up in case you need to undo.

## 🧠 Custom Prompts

You can create your own prompts tailored to your workflow.

### ➕ Add a New Prompt

1. Go to **Settings → NoteSmith → Custom Prompts**
2. Click **Add Prompt**
3. Give it:
- A **Name** (used in the command palette)
- A **Prompt Template** (e.g., _"Summarize this note in bullet points."_)

### 📋 Use a Custom Prompt

1. Open the note you want to process
2. Open the **Command Palette**
3. Run `NoteSmith: Run "<Your Prompt Name>"`

---

## 💬 Prompt Tips

- The entire note is inserted as `{{content}}` in your template.
- You can create prompts for:
- Simplifying technical notes
- Converting meeting notes to action items
- Translating to another language
- Rewriting in a different tone (formal, casual, persuasive)

Example prompt:

```
Rewrite the following content in a professional tone with clear bullet points:
{{content}}
```

## 🧪 Advanced Options

You can also fine-tune NoteSmith’s behavior under **Settings → NoteSmith**:

- **Model Name** — `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`, or any model your API key supports
- **Temperature** — Adjusts creativity (higher = more variation)
- **Base URL** — Useful for proxies or compatible APIs like Azure or LocalAI

## 🛠 Right-Click Menu

If you prefer mouse workflows:

1. Right-click inside any note
2. Select `NoteSmith → Rewrite with [Prompt Name]`
3. Watch the magic happen 🎩✨

---

## 🧼 Undo / Recovery

- Your original note is automatically stored as a backup in case something goes wrong.
- You can always press `Ctrl+Z` (`Cmd+Z`) immediately after a rewrite to undo.
