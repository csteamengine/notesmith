# Usage

NoteSmith lets you use AI (via the OpenAI API or a compatible endpoint) to revise, summarize, or transform entire notes in Obsidian with just a few clicks. This guide walks you through everything you need to know.

---

## ⚙️Settings

Customize the plugin under **Settings → NoteSmith**:

- **API Key** — Your OpenAI secret key (or compatible provider)
- **Model** — Choose any supported model (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, or others)
- **API URL** — Useful for custom endpoints like LocalAI, Mistral, Azure, etc.
- **Tags** — Tags in you'd like added to your notes where applicable (e.g., `#todo`, `#idea`)
- **Additional Instructions** — Global notes passed to the prompt to tailor all responses

> These options give you control over both the backend service and the tone or focus of the AI output.

3. Run `NoteSmith: Refine Current Note`
4. The plugin will:
